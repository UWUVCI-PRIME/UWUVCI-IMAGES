# UWUVCI-Images

Image files for use in Ultimate Wii U VC Injector.

[UWUVCI can be found here!](https://github.com/stuff-by-3-random-dudes/UWUVCI-AIO-WPF)

## Guidelines:
* Folder structure should be console/productcode/<files>
* Please only use the same file types for bootimages 
  (example: iconTex.tga and bootTvTex.tga are okay, but iconTex.tga and bootTvTex.jpg are not)
* Make sure that the folder always contains at least the iconTex and bootTvTex. It should not be only one of them
